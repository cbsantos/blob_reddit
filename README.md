# Reddit Personal Automation Script

This repository contains a small, non-commercial Python script that connects to the
Reddit Data API to automate posting from my own account and retrieve engagement
information (comments, mentions, and inbox replies).

The code uses PRAW and is limited strictly to low-volume personal use in
a small number of subreddits where I already participate.

No data is shared, sold, or used for machine learning.
